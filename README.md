# DET-DRIVE: A Tool for Deterministic Replay-Based Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems 

(Submitted to ICST 2026 (under review))

DET-DRIVE is a framework for evaluating Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) in a fully deterministic simulation environment. The framework enables replay-based evaluation by replacing the ego vehicle in recorded CARLA simulations with an autonomous driving agent(s). 
This repository contains scripts and tools to:

• generate replay logs of flaky scenarios in CARLA  
• evaluate ADS in deterministic replay environments using DET-DRIVE  
• reproduce the experimental results presented in the paper

```

## Prerequisites
All scripts assume using:
```
Ubuntu 20.04+
CARLA 0.9.10.1
conda
```
Install the required packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Contents

## 1. Recording Replay Logs for Flaky Scenarios
The `data_generation` directory contains scripts used to generate replay logs for 43 flaky CARLA leaderboard scenarios.

## 2. CARLA
The script: 'REPLICATE.sh' runs **TransFuser++** on CARLA Leaderboard routes and records simulation logs for flaky scenarios. These logs are later used to evaluate ADS under deterministic replay conditions.
For the experiments reported in the paper, CARLA was run using: 20 FPS simulation rate. 

## 3. Deterministic Evaluation with DET-DRIVE
The script: 'DETDRIVE.sh' runs DET-DRIVE to evaluate TransFuser++ in a fully deterministic replay environment using the previously recorded scenarios.
During evaluation:
1. A CARLA replay log is loaded.
2. The original ego vehicle is removed.
3. The ADS under test is attached as the new ego agent.
4. The agent drives in the replayed environment under deterministic simulation settings.
This enables consistent and reproducible evaluation across multiple runs.
The following pipeline illustrates how DET-DRIVE evaluates an autonomous driving system in a deterministic replay environment.

### Experimental pipeline

```bash
cd ./data_generation/carla
chmod +x ./scripts/*

# Download CARLA
./scripts/setup_carla.sh

# Download TransFuser++
./scripts/setup_garage.sh

# Activate environment
conda activate garage

# Generate flaky scenarios
./scripts/REPLICATE.sh

# Run DET-DRIVE deterministic evaluation
